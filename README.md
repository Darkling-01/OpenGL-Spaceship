# SpaceShip Shooter

This OpenGL project is designed to be familiar with Computer Graphics, shaders, rendering, game development, and how to use the GPU.
The end goal of this project is to design a simple 2D game that relates to the Asteroids arcade game from the 80s. 

I hope to finish this project by the end of June 30, 2024.
